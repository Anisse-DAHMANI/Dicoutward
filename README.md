# Dicoutward

Hello, dear developpers ! I'm Anisse. I'm student in science computer. Out of envy, I'm making an application for Outward players. It's an kind of encyclopedia to help them organize their game with craftable items, quests, map etc..

Here is my source if you are interesed ;)

## Last update : The "Crafting" part is complete. So in the application, we can only use the "Crafting" menu. Other buttons are inactive.
